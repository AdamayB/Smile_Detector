# Smile_Detector
It is really important to smile. Using OpenCV in Python, I made a Smile Detector Application, that might give you a reason to show those pearly whites.

This is a very robust app for detecting smiling faces in a live Web Cam footage.

**Language**: Python

**Modules**: OpenCV


Limitation:
1) This app uses 2 algorithms- one to detect faces and another to detect smiles. These algorithms already exist on the internet. The face detection algo is pretty accurate as it has been tested on thousands of datasets, but it is not 100% accurate.
2) The smile algorithm is not very accurate as well.
3) Thus, this app doesn't ensure 100% accuracy but it still works pretty well.

This project will be fine tuned and improved as I gain more knowledge.
